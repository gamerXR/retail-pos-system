# Push NexPOS to GitHub - Step by Step Guide

## 🎯 For: gamerXR
## 📦 Repository: https://github.com/gamerXR/retail-pos-system

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Create GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `retail-pos-system`
   - Visibility: **Private** (recommended) or Public
   - **DON'T** check "Initialize this repository with a README"
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Install Git on Windows:**
   - Download: https://git-scm.com/download/win
   - Run installer with default options
   - Verify: Open PowerShell and run `git --version`

---

## 🚀 Method 1: Using Git CLI (Recommended)

Since you're working in Leap's cloud environment, you can't push directly from Leap. Instead, I'll help you download and push from your Windows machine.

### Step 1: Download All Files from Leap

**Unfortunately, Leap doesn't have a direct download feature**, so you'll need to use **Method 2** below (GitHub Web Upload), OR:

**Wait for me to create a downloadable archive** (coming next).

---

## 🌐 Method 2: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest!)

This is the simplest method since you can't download the entire project from Leap easily.

### Step 1: Create Files Manually on Your Windows Machine

I'll give you the exact content of each file. You'll create them on your Windows machine.

**Create this folder structure in `C:\nexpos\`:**

```
C:\nexpos\
├── backend\
├── frontend\
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
└── deploy.sh
```

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub

Two options:

**Option A: Upload via GitHub Web Interface**

1. Go to: https://github.com/gamerXR/retail-pos-system
2. Click: "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag all files and folders
4. Commit changes

**Option B: Use Git Commands**

After creating all files locally:

```powershell
# Open PowerShell in C:\nexpos\
cd C:\nexpos

# Initialize git
git init
git config user.name "gamerXR"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit - NexPOS retail system"

# Add remote (your repo)
git remote add origin https://github.com/gamerXR/retail-pos-system.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for credentials:
- Username: `gamerXR`
- Password: Use your **Personal Access Token** (not your GitHub password)

---

## 🔑 Creating GitHub Personal Access Token

Since GitHub no longer accepts passwords for Git operations:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click: "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Note: `NexPOS deployment`
4. Expiration: 90 days (or your preference)
5. Scopes: Check `repo` (full control)
6. Click: "Generate token"
7. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)
8. Use this token as your password when pushing

## 📦 What I'll Do Next

Since downloading from Leap is complex, I'll provide you with:

1. ✅ Complete file listings for all backend files
2. ✅ Complete file listings for all frontend files
3. ✅ All configuration files
4. ✅ Step-by-step instructions to recreate the project on your Windows machine

Then you can:
- Create the files manually (I'll provide all content)
- Or upload them via GitHub web interface
- Or use Git commands to push

---

## 🤔 Which Method Do You Prefer?

**Option 1:** I provide you with all file contents, you create them manually on Windows
- Pros: Complete control, learn the structure
- Cons: Takes time, manual work

**Option 2:** I give you a script that creates all files automatically
- Pros: Fast, automated
- Cons: Still need to copy-paste the script

**Option 3:** Upload via GitHub Web Interface
- Pros: No Git knowledge needed
- Cons: Need to create files first

**Which option works best for you?**

Let me know and I'll proceed with the next steps!
