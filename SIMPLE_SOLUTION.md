# üéØ SIMPLEST SOLUTION - Deploy NexPOS to nexpos.store

## The Problem
You need to get this Leap project to your VPS at nexpos.store.

## The Solution
Skip the Windows machine entirely! Deploy directly from Leap to your VPS.

---

## üöÄ DIRECT VPS DEPLOYMENT (Recommended - 15 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites on Your VPS

SSH into your VPS:

```bash
ssh nexpos25@103.103.22.68
```

Install Node.js and Docker (if not already done):

```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Node.js 20
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Verify
node --version  # Should show v20.x.x
npm --version   # Should show 10.x.x

# Docker should already be installed, verify:
docker --version
```

### Step 2: Create Project Directory on VPS

```bash
mkdir -p ~/nexpos
cd ~/nexpos
```

### Step 3: Transfer Files from Leap to VPS

**Option A: Using SCP (From your local machine where you access Leap)**

If you can download files from Leap to your local machine, then:

```powershell
# On Windows PowerShell
scp -r C:\path\to\downloaded\project\* nexpos25@103.103.22.68:~/nexpos/
```

**Option B: Manual File Transfer (Easier)**

Since you're in Leap now, I'll provide you with curl commands to download each critical file directly to your VPS.

On your VPS, run these commands:

```bash
cd ~/nexpos

# Create directory structure
mkdir -p backend/auth/migrations
mkdir -p backend/pos/migrations
mkdir -p frontend/components/ui
mkdir -p frontend/lib
mkdir -p frontend/public
```

Now, **I'll create downloadable links for each file** that you can wget directly to your VPS.

**OR** - Better yet - **I'll create a GitHub Gist with all files** that you can clone!

## üí° EVEN SIMPLER: GitHub Gist Approach

### Step 1: I'll Upload to GitHub Gist

I'll create public GitHub Gists with all your code, then you can:

```bash
# On your VPS
cd ~/nexpos

# Download files from gist
curl -o Dockerfile https://gist.githubusercontent.com/...
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://gist.githubusercontent.com/...
# ... etc
```

---

## üéØ ABSOLUTE SIMPLEST: Manual Copy-Paste (20 minutes)

Since automated transfer is complex, here's what will definitely work:

### You need these CRITICAL files only:

1. **Dockerfile**
2. **docker-compose.yml**  
3. **package.json** (root)
4. **backend/** folder (entire)
5. **frontend/** folder (entire)

**I'll provide the complete content of each file in separate messages.**

You'll:
1. SSH into your VPS
2. Create each file with `nano filename`
3. Copy-paste the content I provide
4. Save (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)

Then run:

```bash
cd ~/nexpos
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

## ‚ùì Which Method Do You Prefer?

**Type:**
- **A** - I'll provide copy-paste content for each critical file (20 min manual work)
- **B** - I'll create a downloadable GitHub repo you can clone (5 min automated)
- **C** - I'll help you transfer from Windows if you can download from Leap first

**Which option? (A, B, or C)**
